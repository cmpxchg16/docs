## Setup

The project has multiple components, the easiest way to start is by using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

<Note>
[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/quickstart/#starting-your-cluster) requires max virtual memory areas `vm.max_map_count` to be `262144`, and in some environments it's `65530`, so check first and apply workaround to make sure it's the correct value.   
Run first:    
`docker run -u root -it opensearchproject/opensearch:2.9.0 bash -c "cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count"`   
if that command return `65530`, run that command to increase it temporarily:   
`docker run --rm --privileged alpine sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`   
and run again the previos command to make sure the new value set to `262144`    
`docker run -u root -it opensearchproject/opensearch:2.9.0 bash -c "cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count"`    
</Note>

<Note>
OpenSearch on Linux machine need to change the owner of the filesystem volumes, so run:    
`mkdir vibraniumdome-opensearch/vibraniumdome-opensearch-data1`    
`mkdir vibraniumdome-opensearch/vibraniumdome-opensearch-data2`    
`sudo chown -R 1000:1000 vibraniumdome-opensearch/vibraniumdome-opensearch-data1`    
`sudo chown -R 1000:1000 vibraniumdome-opensearch/vibraniumdome-opensearch-data2`    
</Note>

<Note>
Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in [environment file](https://github.com/genia-dev/vibraniumdome/blob/main/vibraniumdome-shields/.env.example), you can generate one [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```git clone https://github.com/genia-dev/vibraniumdome```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change directory to vibraniumdome">
    ```cd vibraniumdome```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the project with docker-compose">
    ```docker-compose up```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open The Application">
    Navigate to [Vibranium-App](http://localhost:3000/)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>There are two authentication providers in the app: Google and Basic credentials. To make the Google login work, you need to register an [OAuth 2.0 application on Google Cloud Platform](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en). The default username and password for the login are: username: `admin@admin.com` and password: `admin`. You can change it [here](https://github.com/genia-dev/vibraniumdome/blob/main/vibraniumdome-app/prisma/seed.ts).</Note>

<Tip>
The previous command of `docker-compose up` use existing docker images in docker-hub, if you would like to modify & build the project from source locally, you can run the docker-compose in build mode by:    
```
cp vibraniumdome-app/.env.example .env    
docker-compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build
```
</Tip>

### Analyze your first LLM interaction
<Tip>There are two ways to start scanning your LLM application: by code, or by using a Streamlit app that is included in the Docker Compose.</Tip>

#### *Analyze LLM Interactions by streamlit app*
After you run the `docker-compose up` of the whole system like in the above instructions, navigate to [VibraniumDome-Streamlit-App](http://localhost:8501/).

In the left pane of the streamlit app in the `Environment Variables` section you need to configure the OpenAI API Key.
The Streamlit app, by default, uses http://localhost:3000 for the `Vibranium Dome Base URL (optional)`. You can change this to point to a different URL.

Now you can chat in the app, and see the results in [Vibranium-App](http://localhost:3000/).

#### *Analyze LLM Interactions by code*
<Note>
Make sure to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
</Note>
##### Install the Vibranium Dome SDK
<Note>This step should be done in the Agent code, can be skipped in the server installation.</Note>

```
pip3 install vibraniumdome-sdk openai==0.28.1
```

#### Create demo application in `main.py`

```python
import os
import openai

from vibraniumdome_sdk import VibraniumDome

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

VibraniumDome.init(app_name="set_you_agent_name_here")

def main():
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ],
    temperature=0,
    request_timeout=5,
    user="user-123456",
    headers={"x-session-id": "abcd-1234-cdef"},)

    print(response)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Run the demo application
```
python3 main.py
```

#### Navigate to [Vibranium-App](http://localhost:3000/) to see the results.

<Tip>You can control the Vibranium Dome service URL by setting this environment variable `VIBRANIUM_DOME_BASE_URL` (default: http://localhost:5001)</Tip>

The shields are designed to offer controls over [The LLM Agents top vulnerabilities by OWASP](https://llmtop10.com/)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Prompt Injections LLM01" icon="square-1">
    <br />
    Crafty inputs can manipulate a Large Language Model, causing unintended actions.
    Direct injections overwrite system prompts, while indirect ones manipulate inputs
    from external sources.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM02: Insecure Output Handling" icon="square-2">
    <br />
    This vulnerability occurs when an LLM output is accepted without scrutiny, exposing
    backend systems. Misuse may lead to severe consequences like XSS, CSRF, SSRF,
    privilege escalation, or remote code execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM04: Model Denial of Service" icon="square-4">
    <br />
    Attackers cause resource-heavy operations on Large Language Models leading to
    service degradation or high costs. The vulnerability is magnified due to the
    resource-intensive nature of LLMs and unpredictability of user inputs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure" icon="square-6">
    <br />
    LLM's may reveal confidential data in its responses, leading to unauthorized
    data access, privacy violations, and security breaches. Itâ€™s crucial to implement
    data sanitization and strict user policies to mitigate this.{" "}
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design" icon="square-7">
    <br />
    LLM plugins can have insecure inputs and insufficient access control. This lack
    of application control makes them easier to exploit and can result in consequences
    like remote code execution.{" "}
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM08: Excessive Agency" icon="square-8">
    <br />
    LLM-based systems may undertake actions leading to unintended consequences. The
    issue arises from excessive functionality, permissions, or autonomy granted to
    the LLM-based systems.

The Vibranium Shields are designed to take their configuration from the security policy which are managed by the security team using the Vibranium app backoffice.
Shields are plug and play and new ones can be easily implemented by the community.
they hold security best practices, integration with SOTA prompt injection models and engineering best practices

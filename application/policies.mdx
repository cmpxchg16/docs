title: Vibranium Dome Policy
description: 'Vibranium policy are the bluepring upon which the LLM interaction shields operate'
---

Vibranium Dome policies are managed through Vibranium Dome application web interface. their granularity level is applicaiton.
The default policy is used by new applications, for which no speficic overriding policy is defined.
<br />
The Policy has the following configuration:
- shield name: a name that will refer to this policy in the system for example in logs or alerts.
- The main 'knob' that control all the policy shields is the shields filter that can have the following values: 
    - "all" - means the policy is active and all shields should be executed according to their configuration
    - "dry_run" - means the policy instruct the shields to run but avoid any risk impact. this is a good practice for new Agents which are under staging and do not have a real user impact, or when the security team wants to observe a new policy configuration that might be noisy due to too many false positives.
    - "skip" - means the policy should be skipped altogether. this is a good practice for LLM Agents the security team wants to avoid any security oversight, for example during development or no user impact
- high_risk_threshold - the risk threshold above which a shield execution calculated risk is considered as 'High', default is 0.8.
- low_risk_threshold: - the risk threshold below which a shield execution calculated risk is considered as 'None', default is 0.2. the risk is considered 'low' otherwise
